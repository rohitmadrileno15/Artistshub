Keeping this simple, you can see in the py file, there is no password hashing involved here! Neither in Login or Register. 
However this is not the same as in case of the main website https://artistshub0site.pythonanywhere.com

The main site has a password hashing tool that is developed by me, but it still needs some additional functions, which is again one of the reasons why i have not included any forgot password functionality in the production server.

I feel that, this is actually incomplete in its truest form - ideally which i thought to make it but simply discontinued because i saw it gaining no traction at all as for the community for whom i made it in the first place.
You may see some additional styles tags that i used to experiment with the UI, you may try to do so with it too.

For any info- Do contact me!
